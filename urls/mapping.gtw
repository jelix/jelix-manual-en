~~LANG:FR@frman:urls/mapping~~

The configuration principle of this engine is to indicate in a
@@F@var/config/urls.xml@@ file all the possible url forms in the application,
and the actions that will be associated to them. Here is an example of file:

<code xml>
<urls xmlns="http://jelix.org/ns/urls/1.0">
    <entrypoint name="index" default="true">

        <url pathinfo="/news/:annee/:mois/:id-:title" module="news" action="view">
           <param name="annee" type="year"/>
           <param name="mois"  type="month" />
           <param name="id"   type="number" />
           <param name="title"   escape="true" />
        </url>

        <url pathinfo="/articles/:rubrique/:id_art" module="cms" action="show">
           <param name="id_art" regexp="\d+"/>
        </url>

    </entrypoint>
    <entrypoint name="shop" type="classic">
       <url pathinfo="/:category/:product" module="unittest" action="url2">
          <param name="product"  regexp="\d{2}" />
          <static name="mystatic" value="valeur statique" />
        </url>
    </entrypoint>
    <classicentrypoint name="foo/bar">
       <url handler="urlsig" module="unittest" action="url4" />
    </classicentrypoint>

    <classicentrypoint name="news">
        <url module="news" />
    </classicentrypoint>
    <entrypoint name="xmlrpc" default="true" type="xmlrpc"/>
    <entrypoint name="jsonrpc" default="true" type="jsonrpc"/>
</urls>
</code>

===== Entrypoint tags =====

The @@E@urls@@ root tag contains the same number of @@E@entrypoint@@ tags as
entrypoints available in your application. 

Each of these tags has a @@A@name@@ attribute specifying the name of the entry
point (without the .php extension), or, precisely, its relative path to the
@@basePath@@ indicated into the main configuration. And you could set eventually
a @@A@default@@ attribute specifying if this entry point is the default one for
the actual type of request.

An @@E@entrypoint@@ tag should also have a @@A@type@@ attribute which indicates
the type of the entry point : @@classic@@, @@xmlrpc@@, @@soap@@ etc. If this
attribute is not present, the default value is @@classic@@.

For compatibility reasons with older version of jelix, you can use other name
for @@E@entrypoint@@ elements. Their exact name gives the type of request they
are affected to: 

   * @@E@classicentrypoint@@ for classical request, 
   * @@E@xmlrpcentrypoint@@ for xmlrpc 
   * etc... 

However this kind of names are now deprecated.

===== Url tag =====

Each module is accessible through a specific entry point, so you should declare
urls of modules in the corresponding entry point element.

==== Specify the default action, the homepage ====

Every application has an homepage at the @@/@@ url. 

So you have at least one url to define on each "classic" entry points:


<code xml>
<urls xmlns="http://jelix.org/ns/urls/1.0">
    <entrypoint name="index" default="true">
        <url pathinfo="/" module="main" action="default:index" />
    </entrypoint>
</url>
</code>

So here the url @@index.php/@@ correspond to the method @@index@@ of the controller
@@default@@ in the module @@main@@.

Before Jelix 1.7, the home page was defined in the @@startModule@@ and @@startAction@@
parameters in the configuration of each entry points.

==== Automatic urls for modules ====

As you will see below, you can define url for each action. But it is not required.

By default, urls are like @@<entrypoint>.php/<module>/<controller>/<method>@@.

But you have at least to indicate on which entry point the module is
accessible, and so to specify the ''url tag for module'': a @@<url>@@ indicating
only a module name.

<code xml>
    <entrypoint name="index" default="true">
        <url pathinfo="/" module="main" action="default:index" />
        <url module="main" />
    </entrypoint>
    <entrypoint name="blog">
        <url module="news" />
    </entrypoint>
</code>

Here all urls of the @@news@@ module are like @@blog.php/news/<controller>/<method>@@.

You can also indicate a pathinfo: it then replaces the module name into the url.

With this example:


<code xml>
    <entrypoint name="index" default="true">
        <url pathinfo="/" module="main" action="default:index" />
        <url pathinfo="/awesome/informations/" module="news" />
    </entrypoint>
</code>

The urls of the @@news@@ module are like @@index.php/awesome/informations/<controller>/<method>@@.

If there isn't an ''url tag for module''.


==== Specify a complete url form ====

=== According to a pathinfo ===

You want to indicate the module and the action to execute for a particular url
form. You will then indicate a @@A@pathinfo@@ attribute, specifying the model of
the pathinfo part the url must be like, and the module and the action in the
@@A@module@@ and @@A@action@@ attributes.

The @@A@pathinfo@@ attribute must then contain the value of a pathinfo. In this
example, every url with "/foo/bar" pathinfo will correspond to the module and
the action indicated.

<code xml>
   <url pathinfo="/foo/bar" module="hello" action="world" />
</code>

You can set the attribute @@A@optionalTrailingSlash="true"@@ if you want that if
there is a trailing slash or not, it correspond to the same action, ie,
@@/foo/bar/@@ and @@/foo/bar@@ are the same action (by default, it is not the
case). You can set this attribute on the @@E@entrypoint@@ element, so all it is
activated for all defined urls.

=== According to a pathinfo with undefined parts ===

It is possible to indicate "dynamic" parts in the pathinfo. They are defined as
two points (:) followed by a name. The retrieved value will then be placed in a
parameter with the same name. In the following example, the pathinfo contains
two dynamical parts: ''chapter'' and ''id_art''.

<code xml>
   <url pathinfo="/articles/:chapter/:id_art" module="cms" action="show" />
</code>

If we use the "/articles/planes/544" url, then the ''chapter'' and ''id_art''
parameters will be created and will be the "planes" and "544" value
respectively.

Be careful: to avoid the confusion with other urls, at least one static part is
needed (here "/articles/" in the url to distinguish it from the others).


=== The typed and formatted undefined parts ===

Another way to avoid resemblances is to specify the format or the type of each
parameter. By default, the type is a classical string. 

For this, you have to indicate @@E@<param>@@ tags for each parameter which you
want to specify the type/format of. They will have to contain a @@A@name@@
attribute indicating the parameter, and either a @@A@type@@ attribute or a
@@A@regexp@@ attribute, containing a regular expression of the format (without
delimiter). In our example, we want to specify that @@chapter@@ is a string, and
a regular expression for @@id_art@@:

<code xml>
   <url pathinfo="/articles/:chapter/:id_art" module="cms" action="show">
      <param name="chapter" type="string" />
      <param name="id_art" regexp="\d+" />
   </url>
</code>


if the regular expression of the attribute regexp contains parentheses, it's
necessary to say that this one should not be catched. Example:

<code xml>
    <param name="type" regexp="(?:0|1|2){1}" />
</code>

When the parameter is of string type, it is not mandatory to specify a
@@A@param@@ tag. The available types are:

| string | a string |
| letter | one letter alone |
| number | an integer number,equivalent to 'int' et 'integer' too |
| digit  | a digit |
| date   | a date according to the AAAA-MM-JJ format |
| year   | a year on four digits |
| month | a month on two digits |
| day | a day on two digits |
| path | a sub-path of the url. this parameter must be the last one in the URL |

Notice: you must of course indicate the values of these parameters when calling
@@C@jUrl@@.

=== Static parameters ===

It can be sometimes necessary to add "static" parameters, awaited by the action
(which can be attributed to several different urls), but not present in the url.
For this you have to add @@E@<static>@@ elements, with value and name like in
this example:

<code xml>
   <url pathinfo="/:category/:product" module="shop" action="view">
      <param name="product"  regexp="\d{2}" />
      <static name="details" value="0" />
   </url>
   <url pathinfo="/:category/:product/details" module="shop" action="view">
      <param name="product"  regexp="\d{2}" />
      <static name="details" value="1" />
   </url>
</code>

Here, we use the same action for two different urls. The processing will be
partly different according to the @@details@@ parameter. In this case, we would
display the product of a catalogue, with general characteristics, and in the
other its general **and** detailed characteristics. This avoids to create to
different actions for so small difference.

We can use this mechanism to support language, for instance:

<code xml>
   <url pathinfo="/articles/en/:page" module="cms" action="page:view">
      <param name="page"/>
      <static name="lang" value="en_US" />
   </url>
   <url pathinfo="/articles/fr/:page" module="cms" action="page:view">
      <param name="page"/>
      <static name="lang" value="fr_FR" />
   </url>
</code>

You should not forget to give the @@lang@@ parameter to jUrl.

<code php>
jUrl::get('cms~page:view', array('page'=>'foo', 'lang'=>jApp::config()->locale));
// or
jUrl::get('cms~page:view', array('page'=>'foo', 'lang'=>"en_US"));
</code>

<code html>
<a href="{jurl 'cms~page:view', array('page'=>'foo', 'lang'=>$j_locale}">my link</a>
<a href="{jurl 'cms~page:view', array('page'=>'foo', 'lang'=>'fr_FR'}">my link</a>
</code>

==== Automatic parameters for language ====

=== with static parameters ===

We saw that we could declare static parameters containing the code of the language,
to have different URLs pointing to the same action. However, it causes some issues:

   - you have to give the parameter to @@jUrl::get()@@, and in most of case, you use the current language code (@@jApp::config()->locale@@).
   - in the action you have to set yourself the language code in the configuration, with the given value in the parameter.

Jelix 1.4 brings some improvements about these issues. You just have to add the attribute @@A@type="locale"@@
or  @@A@type="lang"@@, and then, everything is automatic. You can define for example:

<code xml>
   <url pathinfo="/articles/english/:page" module="cms" action="page:view">
      <param name="page"/>
      <static name="lang" value="en_US" type="locale"/>
   </url>
   <url pathinfo="/articles/francais/:page" module="cms" action="page:view">
      <param name="page"/>
      <static name="lang" value="fr_FR" type="locale" />
   </url>
</code>

If you call simply @@jUrl::get('cms~page:view', array('page'=>'foo'))@@, then jUrl
will generate @@/articles/english/foo@@ if the current language is "en_US", or
@@/articles/francais/foo@@ if it is "fr_FR". You don't have to indicate the language code
as before: @@jUrl::get('cms~page:view', array('page'=>'foo', 'lang'=>jApp::config()->locale))@@.
However, you can still give it if you want to force the language code (one code different from the default one).

During the call of the page @@/articles/english/foo@@ or @@/articles/francais/foo@@,
Jelix will configure automatically the locale. So when the user call the page
@@/articles/english/foo@@, the current language will be "en_US".

You can also use @@A@type="lang"@@. In this case, you just have to indicate the lang code ('en', 'fr'...),
either in the attribute @@A@value@@, or to @@jUrl::get()@@.

<code xml>
    <static name="lang" value="fr" type="lang" />
</code>

=== With dynamic parameters ===

Since Jelix 1.4, you can have parameters with the type "locale" or "lang".

<code>
   <param name="lg" type="lang"/>
   <!-- or -->
   <param name="lg" type="locale"/>
</code>

It allows you to have a language code into the "pathinfo" of the URL, without indicating
it to @@jUrl::get()@@, but alos to configure automatically the current language during the
execution of the action.

Then, the previous example: 
<code xml>
   <url pathinfo="/articles/en/:page" module="cms" action="page:view">
      <param name="page"/>
      <static name="lang" value="en_US" />
   </url>
   <url pathinfo="/articles/fr/:page" module="cms" action="page:view">
      <param name="page"/>
      <static name="lang" value="fr_FR" />
   </url>
</code>

becomes:

<code xml>
   <url pathinfo="/articles/:lang/:page" module="cms" action="page:view">
      <param name="page"/>
      <param name="lang" type="lang" />
   </url>
</code>

If you just call @@jUrl::get('cms~page:view', array('page'=>'foo'))@@,
then jUrl will generate @@/articles/en/foo@@ if the locale is "en_US",
or @@/articles/fr/foo@@ if the locale is "fr_FR".

And if a browser calls @@/articles/en/foo@@, the current locale will be
automatically "en_US".

Contrary to Jelix 1.3 and lower, you then don't have to duplicate
URL declaration for each lang.

Same principle with @@A@type="locale"@@, except that jUrl will generate @@/articles/en_US/foo@@.


==== Using an handler ====

We saw how to use a system to analyse the content of the pathinfo. However,
sometimes it is not enough, and we need a more complex parsing. For example,
parts of a pathinfo can be some data stored in a database, and we need to search
in the database this parts to get some ids or whatever..

So in some case, we want to create our own parser, called an "handler" (an other
solution is to create a new url engine but it is more complicated).

To create an handler, you create a specific class:
<code php>

class myHandlerUrlsHandler implements jIUrlSignificantHandler {

    function parse($url){
        
        if(preg_match("/^\/(.*)$/",$url->pathInfo,$match)){
            $urlact = new jUrlAction($url->params);
            $urlact->setParam('page',jUrl::unescape($match[1]));
            return $urlact;
        }else
            return false;
    }

    function create($urlact, $url){

        $p=jUrl::escape($url->getParam('page'));

        $url->pathInfo = "/$f";
        $url->delParam('page');
    }
}
</code>

The class name should end by "UrlsHandler", and the name of the handler is the
prefix (here "myHandler"). Then the class should be stored in the @@F@classes/@@
directory of a module. The file should be named like ''prefix''.urlhandler.php.
In our example, it should be @@F@myHandler.urlhandler.php@@.

The method @@M@parse()@@ should parse the url given as argument (a @@C@jUrl@@
object). If your handler recognize the url, it should return a @@C@jUrlAction@@
object, else it should return false.

The method @@M@create()@@ is called each time the application ask the url
corresponding to an action. This method receive a @@C@jUrlAction@@ object and a
@@C@jUrl@@ object. @@$urlaction@@ contains the parameters of the action. This
parameters are already stored in the @@$url@@ object. Then you should modify the
@@$url@@ object in order to generate the corresponding true url. So in fact, you
should generate the pathinfo, and/or delete some parameters... 

Note that you can use @@M@jUrl::escape()@@ and @@M@jUrl::unescape()@@, to
cleanup strings (by removing some special characters for example).

Then, in the @@F@urls.xml@@ file, you have to specify the handler:
<code xml>
   <classicentrypoint name="wiki">
       <url handler="myHandler" module="unittest" action="url4" />
    </classicentrypoint>
</code>

Of course, the handler can be stored in any module:
<code xml>
   <classicentrypoint name="wiki">
       <url handler="othermodule~myHandler" module="unittest" action="url4" />
    </classicentrypoint>
</code>


==== The same URL for several possible actions ====

Let's imagine that we have a url of the following pattern, @@/article/54-title@@, and
this displays the article number 54 with a view action associated for example:

<code xml>
   <url pathinfo="/article/:id_art-:title" module="cms" action="view" />
</code>

We want to able to indicate other actions in some case without changing the url, with an action parameter:

   * @@/article/54-title?action=edit@@
   * @@/article/54-title?action=delete@@

Notice: we could also do @@/article/54-title/edit@@ or
@@/article/54-title/delete@@, with thus several @@E@<url>@@ tags, which would
avoid what follows. But this would not be very good when the url is called by a
form for example.

To specify the authorized alternative actions, we add an @@A@actionoverride@@
attribute, containing the list of the actions separated by a space or a comma:

<code xml>
   <url pathinfo="/article/:id_art-:title" module="cms" action="view" actionoverride="edit,delete" />
</code>



==== Specify that an entry point is dedicated to a particular module ====

You not always want to indicate a significant url for the actions of particular
module. However, you have created an entry point dedicated to this module. All
these actions will pass through this entry point. You just then have to do it
like this:

<code xml>
    <classicentrypoint name="news">
        <url module="news" />
    </classicentrypoint>
</code>

You can specify several module like that on a same entry point.

==== Specify some secured urls (https) for specific actions====

For some actions, you could want to access them through an https access. So you
should add a @@A@https@@ attribute (with "true" as a value) on the @@E@<url>@@
elements you want. If you want to specify https on all actions of an entrypoint,
then you can put the @@A@https@@ attribute on the entrypoint element instead of
each url element.

==== Including urls files of modules ====

You can define URLs in separate files, in each module, and then
declare those files into the main @@F@urls.xml@@ file. It avoid to have a big main
@@F@urls.xml@@ file, and more important, to avoid to declare or rewrite all url
of a module in this file, when you install a module made by someone.

To do it, you shoud create a file, @@F@urls.xml@@ (or with an other name), in
the directory of the module. This file should have a @@E@suburls@@ element as
root element, instead of @@E@urls@@, and have all needed @@E@url@@ element to
declare all urls mapped to each action of the module. You should not use
@@E@entrypoint@@ elements of course. Here is the urls.xml file of the jauth
module:

<code xml>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<suburls xmlns="http://jelix.org/ns/suburls/1.0">
    <url pathinfo="/dologin" action="login:in" />
    <url pathinfo="/dologout" action="login:out" />
    <url pathinfo="/login" action="login:form"/>
</suburls>
</code>

And in the main urls.xml file, in one of your @@E@entrypoint@@ element, you indicate:

<code xml>
  <entrypoint name="index">
    ...
     <url pathinfo="/auth" module="jauth" include="urls.xml" />
  </entrypoint>
</code>

It means: urls declared in the @@F@urls.xml@@ file of the module jauth should be
included, and should be prefixed by the given pathinfo "/auth/". So the url of
the "jauth~login:in" action will be "/auth/dologin".

You notice that URLS defined in a module file are not "full" URL. It allow the
developer to choose the first part of URLs, and it avoid to have conflict with
other URLS declared in other modules.

In module files, you can declare URL with a static pathinfo, with a pathinfo
with parameters, with an handler, with static values. However you have to
declare an url for all actions. And you cannot of course use the @@A@module@@
attribute.

You have also to create a url file for each type of entry point, if needed.


===== Mod_rewrite and just removing the name of the entry point in the url =====

Perhaps you would prefer that the parsing of the urls will be done by the web
server, by using for example the rewrite mod in Apache.

==== Just remove the entry point ====

Perhaps you would like to remove the name of the entry point in the urls
generated and parsed by Jelix. But to do it, you have to use and configure the
mod_rewrite module of apache.

For example, you want to have
<code>
   http://monsite.com/news/2017-02-08-il-neige-a-lille.html
</code>
instead of
<code>
   http://monsite.com/index.php/news/2017-02-08-il-neige-a-lille.html
</code>

First, in the @@F@urls.xml@@ file, put the attribute @@A@noentrypoint="true"@@
on the @@E@<url>@@ element or on the @@E@<entrypoint>@@ element.

Second, you should create a @@F@.htaccess@@ file in the @@F@www/@@ directory,
which should contains this rules:

<code>
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php/$1 [L,QSA]
</IfModule>
</code>

    * second line: you don't need it if you write these instructions into an
      @@F@.htaccess@@ in the www directory of your app. However, in an other
      @@F@.htaccess@@ or in the virtual host configuration, you have to write
      it, and you must indicate the right path to the www directory: @@F@/@@ if
      the documentRoot is the www directory, or the path to access this www
      directory from the documentRoot of the website (basePath). Example:
      @@RewriteBase /myapp/www/@@ if you access to your application with
      @@http://localhost.local/myapp/www/index.php@@
    * third and forth lines: url will be rewritten only if doesn't correspond to
      a real file or a real directory. (for css files, images etc..). 
    * fifth line: we get all the content of the url and put it after index.php/,
      so the url become the pathinfo of the new url.

In some apache configuration, you could have an apache error "Error: No input
file specified" (this is the case for example when PHP is executed in cgi mode
and @@cgi.fix_pathinfo=0@@ in php.ini).

There is a solution. You should change the last rule to:
<code>
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?jpathinfo=/$1 [L,QSA]
</code>

So the url is not put as the pathinfo, but as a query parameters. Of course, you
should inform jelix of this parameter. You have to add the
@@pathInfoInQueryParameter@@ parameter in the urlengine section in the jelix
configuration file. @@pathInfoInQueryParameter@@ should contains the name of the
parameter (here in the example, jpathinfo):

<code ini>
 [urlengine]
 ...
 pathInfoInQueryParameter = jpathinfo
</code>
