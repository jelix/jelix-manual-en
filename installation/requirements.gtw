You must install the 5.3 version of PHP at least ([[http://jelix.org/en/news/post/jelix-supports-gophp5|Jelix project supports gophp5 campaign]]). The **dom**, **simplexml**, **pcre**, **session**, **tokenizer** and **spl** extensions are required (they are generally turned on in a standard PHP 5.3 installation).

Note about DOM and XML: verify that the [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.dom.php|DOM extension]] is installed and the [[http://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.domxml.php|DOM-XML extension]] is **not** installed. Some distribution includes both (or only DOM-XML), and then there are some PHP errors within Jelix.

You can install a database connector too. For the moment, Jelix deals with mysql 4.1+, postgresql 8.0+, sqlite and PDO.

**To test the compatibility of your server** with Jelix, install the file @@F@lib/jelix_check_server.php@@ provided into the jelix archive, on your web hosting (without jelix, the framework is not needed), and call this page with your browser (example : http://example.com/jelix_check_server.php). The page displays all missing PHP extensions, if the PHP version is ok etc.

Jelix provides scripts to use in the command line, @@F@createapp.php@@ and @@F@cmd.php@@ (in the application), which help you to develop a Jelix application. So you also should install the command line version of PHP (CLI, php.exe under windows).
