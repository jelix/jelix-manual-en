This chapter explains how to install an existing application developed with
Jelix. Let's imagine we want to install an application named 'testapp'.

===== Files installations =====

Depending of the project, you may have an archive (zip or tar.gz) which contains
all files. Or you may have to retrieve files from a source code repository
(git, mercurial, subversion...). Or you are using modern tools to deploy sources
to the server.

Whatever the solution you are using, you get a directory named 'testapp' for
example, and you may want to install this directory into the @@/srv/@@ directory of your
server. Here the directories you have:

<code>
  /srv/testapp/     application directory
      install/      script to install the application
      modules/      modules of the application
      plugins/      plugins of the application
      app/responses/  common responses for the application
      app/system/    static configuration files of the application
      temp/         where temporary files will be stored
      var/          contain all the files created or that can be modified by Jelix during execution
         config/    configuration files of the application depending of the environment
         log/       log files of jelix and of the application
      www/          root of the site of the application (document root)
</code>

You may have a @@F@lib/@@ directory too, provided into the source code. If not,
you may have to run Composer to retrieve Jelix, or download an archive of Jelix.

The tree structure of the sources is by default organized in order to install
the application on a server on which you can specify the public root directory
of the site (document root). This directory is @@F@/srv/testapp/www@@ .

You will of course be able to move the content of @@www/@@ to an other directory,
but be sure other files are not accessible from a browser, for security reasons.

===== Renaming configuration files =====

In @@F@testapp/var/config@@, you may have @@F@*.dist@@ files. Rename them by
removing this @@.dist@@ suffix. You have certainly some things to modify in this
new files, like database configuration in @@F@profiles.ini.php@@ etc. We will
see how exactly below.

===== Configuring the server =====

You have to configure the web server (virtual host, with a document root..), and
to configure certainly a SQL database.

Read [[server-configuration|the corresponding chapter]] before continuing.

===== Launching the installer of Jelix =====

There is three ways to install the application, depending what is providing with your application.

==== With a wizard ====

If there is a @@F@testapp/www/install.php@@ script, this is certainly a script,
a wizard, to launch with your browser. So open your browser, and go to the url
of this script, for instance @@http://www.mysite.com/install.php@@. Follow
instructions and that's it. The wizard will probably modify configuration file
for you (database access etc), after asking you informations about it. The
installation is then done.

It is recommended to remove the @@F@install.php@@ file (save it in a protected
folder), so it is not accessible anymore from the web.

==== With the application installer ====

Launch the script @@F@testapp/install/configurator.php@@ to configure the
application. Some modules configurators may change some things into configuration
files and may ask you some informations.

Perhaps there will be parameters to set by hand. Fill all needed parameters in
@@F@profiles.ini.php@@ and in @@F@localconfig.ini.php@@ (read the documentation
of the application to know what exactly you have to change).

Then launch the @@F@testapp/install/installer.php@@ script, it will install
the application, create tables in the database and so on.

After this script, the application should work correctly.

==== If the installation system is deactivated into the configuration ====

In some project, especially on internal projects where the installation process
is very specific, a choice has probably be made to deactivate the installation
system (@@disableInstallers=on@@). In this case, no need to launch the
application installer or the jelix installer. However, you have to install all
things needed by the application, "by hand", or by your own scripts of your
installation process.
