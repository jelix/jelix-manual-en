Jelix is provided in the form of a tar.gz or zip file. This file contains a
@@F@jelix/lib@@ directory which contains all the files of the framework and the
dependent libraries, as well as a @@F@jelix/temp@@ directory.

Extract the file with software like winzip, unzip or tar.

<code bash>
  tar xvzf jelix-1.6.14-opt.tar.gz
</code>

You get the following directories : 

  jelix/
     lib/               
        jelix/          source of Jelix
        jelix-admin-modules/  standard modules delivered with Jelix for an admin interface
        jelix-modules/  standard modules delivered with Jelix
        jelix-plugins/  standard plugins delivered with Jelix
        jelix-scripts/  command-line scripts that can help developer
        jelix-www/      web resources: javascript files, css...
     temp/              Temporary files of Jelix applications.

There are other folders in @@F@lib/@@ (not listed here), which are additional libs, external to the jelix project and used by jelix : wikirenderer, JSON, difflib, phpMailer, etc.

For more safety, it is recommended to install these directories out of your website's public directory. You will also be able to share it with several applications. But that is not mandatory, at least on a development environment. We will admit thereafter that you copied these directories in a @@F@mysite/@@ directory.

You have to set write permissions to apache user on the temp directory.

You can now create or install a jelix application.
