~~LANG:FR@frman:jforms/security~~

By default, jForms has some security check. HTML Builders of jforms escape
content during the display, to avoid some security issues like Cross Site
scriptings.

It supports also protection against [[http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-Site_Request_Forgeries|CSRF]]. 
This protection don't allow the submission of the form from an origin other 
than your application. However, if you want to allow any web sites to submit 
data to your form, you can disable this protection. To do it, put an attribute
@@A@allowAnyOrigin="true"@@ on the @@E@<form>@@ element. You can also change 
the @@P@securityLevel@@ property on your form object. It can take one of this 
two value:

   * @@P@jFormsBase::SECURITY_CSRF@@ to enable the CSRF protection (default value)
   * @@P@jFormsBase::SECURITY_LOW@@ to disable it
