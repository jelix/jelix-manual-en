It supports also protection against [[http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-Site_Request_Forgeries|CSRF]]. This protection don't allow the submission of the form from an origin other than your application. However, if you want to allow any web sites to submit data to your form, you can disable this protection. To do it, put an attribute @@A@allowAnyOrigin="true"@@ on the @@E@<form>@@ element. You can also change the @@P@securityLevel@@ property on your form object. It can take one of this two value

   * @@P@jFormsBase::SECURITY_CSRF@@ to enable the CSRF protection (default value)
   * @@P@jFormsBase::SECURITY_LOW@@ to disable it
