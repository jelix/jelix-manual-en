jForms is a form system which makes easier the creation of forms. Forms are described in an XML file, and used throughout an API and template-plugins. it allows you to automatically :

   * generate the HTML form, by displaying required fields, help etc, and in a flexible manner
   * display labels in an accessible manner
   * generate javascript validation script
   * validate data in the server side
   * display verbose error-reporting and helper messages
   * manage several instances of a form at the same time - allowing to edit several records at the same time
   * initialize a form from one or several DAO's data (with inputs, listbox, radios etc ...)
   * save data with DAOs
   * save uploaded files.
   * generate other types of forms (with ajax, XForms etc ...) using some jforms plugins
   * support complex field like native captcha-fields, Wysiwyg editing field, groups, complex choices and so on..
   * modify dynamically the form (add, remove, modify some controls)

jForms includes three distinct parts:

   * [[jforms/xml|XML files]] describing the forms,
   * server-side API to [[jforms/usage|manage a form and it's data]],
   * template plugins to [[jforms/display|display an instance of a form]].

jForms generates an object (which inherits from jFormsBase) from the XML
description, allowing to initialize the form's contents, to save it, to
add/remove some controls etc ... The object contains all the input in it's
properties.

The jForms object is also used by template-plugins to display the appropriate HTML elements.
