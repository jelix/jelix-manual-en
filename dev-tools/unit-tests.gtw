Unit tests should always be used in any project. Jelix allows to integrate
easily tests in modules.

===== Creating tests with PHPUnit =====

Using PHPUnit to create tests is the prefered method.
See [[https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/|the manual of PHPUnit]] to
know how to use it. You must install PHPUnit, it is not provided in the Jelix
package.

Jelix brings some helpers. The @@create-jelix-app@@ command has created a
@@F@tests/runtests.php@@ in your application (or copy the file
@@F@lib/jelix-scripts/templates/tests/runtests.php@@). You will launch this file
instead of PHPUnit. It then discover your tests files in all modules. It avoids
to not fill a @@F@phpunit.xml@@ with all your tests stored in your modules.

To do so:

   * create your tests in the @@tests/@@ directory of your modules
   * store them in files with the suffix @@.pu.php@@ (and not @@Tests.php@@ as usual with PHPUnit)
   * launch @@php runtests.php --all-modules@@ to run tests in all modules
   * launch @@php runtests.php --module foo@@ to run tests only in the module foo
   * you can add the option @@--testtype xxxx@@ and it launches only
     @@*.xxxx.pu.php@@ files. That way, you can separate unit tests,
     functional tests etc..

You can use all others options of PHPUnit with runtests.php.
