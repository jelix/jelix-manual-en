===== Tips for common problems =====

This page gather snippets of code resolving common development problems.

==== Prevent some errors ====

Upon an html request, don't forget that line at the beginning of an action.

<code php>
$rep = $this->getResponse('html');
</code>

==== Retrieve current action ====

Use this expression to retrieve current action in a controller, a zone, your common response.

<code php>
jApp::coord()->action->toString();
</code>

==== Access user session variables ====

Jelix use PHP sessions by default. If you use jAuth, it stores user dao record
(data coming from jelix_user table) in a PHP session variable. Thus, user infos
are accessible through @@jAuth::getUserSession()@@:

<code php>
jAuth::getUserSession()->login
</code>

==== Store current date in database ====

This one applies to date fields having //datetime// or //date// as type. 

Just add the following attributes to the property line associated with your date field and located in your DAO xml file:

<code xml>
<property inserpattern="NOW()" .../>
</code>

your date field will be set to current date on record insert.

<code xml>
<property updatepattern="NOW()" .../>
</code>

your date field will be set to current date on record update.
