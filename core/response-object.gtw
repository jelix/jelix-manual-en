A jResponse object handles the control and the correct generation of the
response, the output data. It represents the view in the MVC pattern. Every
display command use this object.

There is a class extending jResponse for each format that we want to handle :
html, text, binary files, pdf, XML-RPC etc... or for other types of output, like
the redirection.

A jResponse object implements some methods, here are the more useful of them:

   * @@M@addHttpHeader()@@: to add some HTTP header which will be sent at the right time
   * @@M@setHttpStatus()@@: to set the http code  (200, 404,...)
   * @@M@isValidCache()@@, @@M@setExpire()@@ and @@M@setLifeTime()@@ to manage
     the cache of the response.

This methods are available in all type of response.

To know all specificities of all response, see the [[/views/|chapter about responses]].
