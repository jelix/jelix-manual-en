===== Adding a plugins repository =====

You can add one or more plugins repositories. It consists of a directory with a strict
subtree structure. Each plugins repository must be added to @@pluginsPath@@ of your
application [[config|configuration]]. Its default value is:

<code ini>
pluginsPath = lib:jelix-plugins/,app:plugins/
</code>

Different repositories are divided by a comma. Default value indicate two repositories :
@@F@/lib/jelix-plugins@@ directory and your plugins application directory.

Jelix also loads an implicit repository @@F@lib/jelix/plugins@@: it contains all plugins
bundled with Jelix. It also loads all @@F@plugins/@@ directories found into modules. 

Note : @@lib:@@ is a shortcut indicating base @@F@lib/@@ directory and @@app:@@ is a
shortcut for your application directory. You can also use an absolute path but beware to
check if you migrate your application from one host to another. A relative path is also
permitted. it has to be relative to your entry point script (@@F@/var/www/index.php@@ for
example).

===== Repository structure and plugins creation =====

Such a repository has one sub-directory for each plugin type. And within each
sub-directory, each plugin has its own folder. 

Below is the list of plugins type and their respective directory:

    * coordinator plugins: @@F@coord/@@
    * plugins for jLog: @@F@logger/@@
    * jAuth drivers: @@F@auth/@@

===== Plugins development =====

Jelix comes with a bunch of plugins within the standard package. They are located in
@@F@lib/jelix/plugins/@@. However, it is often useful to create your own plugins to
fulfill specific needs. And If your plugin is generic or useful enough, you're likely to
push it to the developers team :-).
