===== jPref =====

jPref is a simple class allowing to save and retrieve some
preferences by your application. By "preferences", we mean some
options that can be changed by the user or that can be change
during the life of the application. Options of mainconfig.ini.php
and other are technical preferences that don't supposed to change.

==== Configuration ====

@@C@jPref@@ is a class provided by the "jpref" module. Activate it
in your configuration:

<code ini>
[modules]
jpref.access = 1
</code>

And run the application installer.

@@C@jPref@@ is a class that use @@C@jKVDb@@. So to use jPref, you just
have to define a profile for @@jkvdb@@, having "jpref" as name.

In your profiles.ini.php:

<code ini>
[jkvdb:jpref]

</code>

To know more about configuration of jKvdb, see [[/kvdb#drivers|its documentation]].

==== Usage ====

   * @@M@jPref::get($key)@@: to retrieve a preference.
   * @@M@jPref::set($key, $value, $ttl)@@: so modify/save a preference.

Example :

<code php>
jPref::set('nb.items.per.page', 20);

$val = jPref::get('nb.items.per.page');
// $val contains 20
</code>

===== Admin interface for jPref =====

A module jpref_admin is provided, to manage preferences from the
administration interface. Pages are directly accessible from the "System"
menu of [[/create-application/administration-app|master_admin]].

However you should fill the file  @@var/config/preferences.ini.php@@ to
add preferences that are editable, and how : their label, default value,
rights to read and modify...

==== Declaring a preference ====

You need to declare the preference only if you want to manage it from
jpref_admin (it is the case most of time, or consider to put the
parameter into mainconfig.ini.php).

In the @@preferences.ini.php@@, you have a section for each
preferences, with the prefix "pref:" :

<code ini>
[pref:preference.name]
; "string" | "integer" | "boolean" | "decimal" (d√©faut string)
type =
; locale key for the label
locale =
; preference group (see below)
group =
; jAcl2 subject corresponding to the right to read the preference value
read_acl_subject =
; jAcl2 subject corresponding to the right to modify the preference value
write_acl_subject =
; default value
default_value =
</code>

Note: each parameters are optional.

@@read_acl_subject@@ and @@write_acl_subject@@ allow to restrict the access
to preferences. Some preferences may not be accessible only by administrator
of the web site for example. So you should defines some rights in jAcl2,
and indicate here the corresponding "subjects". If @@read_acl_subject@@ and
@@write_acl_subject@@ are not filled, the preference can be modified by
any user (except if the user has not the right "jprefs.prefs.list").

==== Declaring a preferences group ====

Your preferences can be grouped, so it can be easier to manage them.
You can have a group per module for example.

In your @@preferences.ini.php@@, declare a section with a prefix "group:".
A section contains the label of the group, and an order value.

<code ini>
[group:nom.syteme.de.la.pref]
; locale key of the label
locale =
; display order
order =
</code>

Note: each parameters are optional.


==== Example ====

<code ini>
[group:contact]
locale = "contact~admin.pref.group.contact"
order = 1

[pref:telephone]
type = string
locale = "contact~admin.pref.telephone"
group = "contact"
read_acl_subject =
write_acl_subject = "contact.edit.infos"
default_value =


[group:shop]
locale = "contact~admin.pref.group.contact"
order = 2

[pref:nb.items.per.page]
type = integer
locale = "shop_admin~admin.pref.nb.items.per.page"
group = shop
read_acl_subject =
write_acl_subject =
default_value = 15

[pref:shop.is.open]
type = boolean
locale = "shop_admin~admin.pref.shop.is.open"
group = shop
read_acl_subject =
write_acl_subject = "shop.edit.shop.status"
default_value = "false"

</code>
